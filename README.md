# BasicSwiftApps - UNDER DEVELOPMENT üèÜ

This repo will contain a wide range of different apps written with Swift on purpose to make me a better programmer. </br>
The level of difficulty will increase with time. I would like to relearn the basics to have solid knowledge and then make more demanding apps. </br>
All App here is part of this [course](https://codewithchris.com/). I try to learn things that I don't know and also add some extra features to them. </br>
Take a look and ask my questions about it‚ùï </br>

## Layout

This section contains a few apps that helped me to learn layout using Storyboard. </br>
However these apps don't work in any way, it's just a layout with no action (as this section I dedicated to layout). </br>
Take a look at the results: </br>

### Layout1 app

### Layou2 app

### Fitness app

### Social Squid app

## Card Wars
My first bigger app was made with the help of this course. </br>
This is a classic card war game. The purpose of this game is to compare card and user/CPU with bigger card wins. </br>
Cards are being shown randomly as in real life. </br> 
The user needs to press the "DEAL" button to start a new round. App automatically shows a card for user and CPU and gives a point to the winner. </br>
Besides using StackView in layout, I have made IBOutlet and IBActions make it works. </br>
Take a look at details in the project üëÄ.</br>
