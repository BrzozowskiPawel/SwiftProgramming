# BasicSwiftApps - UNDER DEVELOPMENT üèÜ

This repo will contain a wide range of different apps written with Swift on purpose to make me a better programmer. </br>
The level of difficulty will increase with time. I would like to relearn the basics to have solid knowledge and then make more demanding apps. </br>
All App here is part of this course. I try to learn things that I don't know and also add some extra features to them. </br>
Take a look and ask my questions about it‚ùï </br>
