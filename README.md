# Swift Programming üèÜ

This repo will contain a wide range of different apps written with Swift on purpose to make me a better programmer. </br>
The level of difficulty will increase with time. </br>
I would like to relearn the basics to have solid knowledge and then make more demanding apps. </br>
All App here are part of this [course](https://codewithchris.com/) and this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) üëÄ.</br>
I try to learn things that I don't know and also add some extra features. </br>
Take a look and ask my questions about it‚ùï </br>

## Layout - first steps in creating a perfect layout for apps!
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand details!</summary>
  
  This section contains a few apps that helped me to learn layout using Storyboard. </br>
  However these apps don't work in any way, it's just a layout with no action (as this section I dedicated to layout). </br>
  Take a look at the results: </br>

## Card Wars - simple user/CPU game with a lot of fun!
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand details!</summary>
  My first bigger app was made with the help of this course. </br>
  This is a classic card war game. The purpose of this game is to compare card and user/CPU with bigger card wins. </br>
  Cards are being shown randomly as in real life. </br> 
  The user needs to press the "DEAL" button to start a new round. App automatically shows a card for user and CPU and gives a point to the winner. </br>
  Besides using StackView in layout, I have made IBOutlet and IBActions make it works. </br>
  Take a look at details in the project üëÄ.</br>

## Guessing picture - guess where are the same picture!
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand details!</summary>
  Classic game where the user has to find the same pictures. </br>
  Each of the cards is upside down, by pressing on its the user can temporarily show the front of the card. </br>
  However, when she/he presses on the second card and the card aren't the same both of them are put upside-down once again. </br>
  Of course, when the user guesses two cards correctly there are being removed from the rest. </br>
 The goal of the game is to guess all the cards before time runs out. BE QUICK! </br>
  
  In this project I have used:
  - timer to measure time (it is working even when user is scrolling)
  - AVFoundation to play sounds
  - CollectionView
  - delegate and datasource for CollectionView
  - CocoaTouch classes

## Star Wars Delegate-Protocol - app to show how delegate-protocol works!
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand details!</summary>
  This app is based on turoial* which helped me to understand how delegating in Swift works. </br>
  Delegate - Protocol is similar to master - slave. </br>
  FirstScreen (just showing something) is slave and SecondScreen(know information from user and send it to first screen) is master. </br>
  Base on the picked side (in SecondScreen) we are showing specific data back on the FirstScreen. </br>
  In the and we can use the function in the FirstScreen when arguments to it come from this function being called in SecondScreen. </br> </br>

## Quiz app - parsing JSON into a quiz!
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand details!</summary>
  Quiz app that uses JSON to create the whole quiz. </br>
  The user has to click on the right answer and then the user's choice is being checked. </br>
  If it's the right answer user gets a point and if he/she is wrong there's no point. </br>
  After all question popup window with a score and restart button is being shown. </br>
  If users close this app, the state of the game is being saved and loaded using UserDefaults. </br> </br>
  
  What I ahve learned and applied in this app:
  - delegate / protocol patern
  - JSON decoding and parsing
  - Networking used to dowload JSON
  - TableView
  - UserDefaults
  - basic animations
  
  Please take a look at app and all its functionality: </br>

  The purpose of this project was to build an app from Figma UI design. </bd>
  The case of this app was to try to rebuild the app as it was designed in Figma. </br>
  Also besides building UI in Swift, I have learned the basics of UI.UX design and Figma. </br> <br>
  
  Here are screeanshots of Figma design: </br>
