Replicas should be only next to each other just move it by the x value to the width and a little extra space. For this example our square has a width or 50, we want it to have a bit of space inbetween so lets say 60 as the value of x. We can set y and z to 0 since we don't want to move them by these values.

        // Since replicated squares should fade away in color slowly we can simply modify the alpha of each instances. CAReplicatorLayer has a property called instanceAlphaOffset tha we can use to automatically modify the alpha value for every replica it creates.

        // To fully utilize our CAReplicatorLayer add an animation to the CALayer. Use for example CABasicAnimation.

        // Opt to delay how each instance is drawn/added. This can be done by simply setting the .instanceDelay in seconds. In order to do that divide the duration of the animation to the number of instances.
